# Setting up 
Download code from git repo:
    git clone http://github.com/fuhchang/gsc

We need npm, if you don't have npm:
    curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Once u have npm:
    npm install http-server -g

Run `http-server` at the directory that `git clone` has created
    cd gsc
    http-server

This application is now accessible at localhost:8080
